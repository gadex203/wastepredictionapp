# 10 — Stats Screen

[← Back to plan index](MOBILE_APP_PLAN.md)

## Goal

Make user impact and progress tangible using simple, readable metrics derived from local history.

---

## Metrics (Initial)

- Total items scanned (confirmed)
- Waste type distribution (counts per waste type)
- Total points
- Current streak + best streak (optional)
- Weekly challenge completion count

---

## Environmental Impact (Demo, Static Values)

If included, keep it clearly “estimated” and based on simple multipliers.

Example message style:

- “Estimated impact: energy equivalent to ~5 hours of lighting.”

Avoid over-precision and add a note explaining it’s a rough estimate.

---

## Visualizations (MVP-Friendly)

- A grid of stat tiles (numbers first)
- Simple bar chart for distribution (can be custom using Views, or SVG later)
